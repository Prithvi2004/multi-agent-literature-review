RETRIEVED PAPERS**\n- Paper 1: \"[Title]\" | [Author A et al.] | [2023] | [Journal Source Name, Volume 45, Issue 6]\n- Abstract: \"In this study, we investigate how lightweight transformer models can achieve competitive performance with reduced computational cost. The experiments demonstrate that these models not only maintain but also improve on accuracy when using less compute resources.\"\n- Relevance Score: [10]\n- Contribution: Investigates the use of lightweight transformer models for achieving competitive performance under resource constraints.\n- Method: Uses a dataset of natural language processing tasks and employs transfer learning with pre-trained weights to demonstrate model efficiency. The experiments compare both training time and inference sp",
