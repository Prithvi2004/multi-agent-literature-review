📊 FINAL NOVELTY REPORT
================================================================================
[Full integrated report combining all agent outputs]

Your research idea has MODERATE NOVELTY (6/10). While lightweight 
transformers are well-studied, there are significant opportunities for 
contribution in:

1. Text classification-specific optimizations
2. Dynamic model scaling based on input complexity
3. Energy efficiency metrics and sustainability focus
4. Cross-architecture knowledge transfer techniques

The field is active with strong baseline methods (DistilBERT achieving 
97% accuracy with 40% parameter reduction). Your work can advance the 
state-of-the-art by combining task-specific compression with adaptive 
scaling and energy-aware optimization.

Recommended Next Steps:
- Review recent 2023-2024 papers on efficient transformers
- Implement baseline DistilBERT for text classification
- Develop dynamic scaling mechanism
- Add energy consumption benchmarking suite
