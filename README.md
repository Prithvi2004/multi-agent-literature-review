# Multi-Agent LLM System for Automated Literature Review and Novelty Detection

## Overview

This project develops a **Multi-Agent Large Language Model (LLM)** framework to automate literature review and research novelty identification. Specialized AI agents collaboratively retrieve, summarize, compare, and analyze research papers to provide structured insights with reliable citation support.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent collaboration for literature retrieval, summarization, and comparison
- Research gap and novelty detection with citation-backed analysis
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucinations
- Simple and intuitive web-based interface

## Technology Stack

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Multi-agent frameworks (LangChain / CrewAI)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Vector databases (FAISS)
- Streamlit-based frontend

## Use Cases

- Academic literature review automation
- Research gap and novelty justification
- Support for students, researchers, and institutions

## Frontend

**https://multi-agent-literature-review.streamlit.app/**

## Project Status

Currently under development and evaluation as part of an academic capstone project.
